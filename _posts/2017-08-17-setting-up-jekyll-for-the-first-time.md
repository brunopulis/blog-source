excerpt: My first experience with Jekyll and how I am stating to love it
---

This is my first **Jekyll**[^1] post and I am testing this thing out. So far looking good and fantastic.

At first I tried vanilla Jekyll theme. It was good but not my type. Then tried **The Plain**[^2] Jekyll theme. It is what I was thinking of but also not perfect for me. So I am going to use this theme as a base and develop my own from it as I see fit. 

This website has only one page and it is my portfolio page. Anyone can visit the page by clicking my `profile picture` from home page or clicking [here](/about)

All though my first reason to setup simple **_Jekyll_** blog is to focus on writing rather than focusing on useless stuffs, but my hacker mind is firing up and here is the list of task I think I should complete to make this blog useful.
- [ ] Set up comment section
- [ ] Show reading time for each notes
- [ ] Setup icons matching the design for post date and 
- [ ] Import blog posts from WordPress/Medium 

**NOTE:** I was sick (Cold Fever) and having trouble concentrating while setting up this blog. So keeping this as simple as possible for the time being.
