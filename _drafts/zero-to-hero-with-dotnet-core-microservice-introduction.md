In this series of blog articles, we are going to start from a basic **dotnet core** `MVC` application and then improve it to full blown Microservices with state of the art Microservices patterns and practices. To follow this blog service, you will need those tools-

1. [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) **v16.3 or later** or [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/), which will make our development process much faster and beginner friendly 
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), as this is my *favorite* test editor and I will use it most of the time
3. [.NET Core SDK 3.0.101](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0), which is the latest stable version of .NET Core SDK.
4. [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) or [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/), we are going to use docker to develop, run and deploy our microservices
