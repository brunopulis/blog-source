Create new `java-application` type `Java` project using `gradle` -

```bash
gradle init --type java-application
```

**Please note:** The Build Init plugin is currently [incubating](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/feature_lifecycle.html). Please be aware that the DSL and other configuration may change in later Gradle versions. To know more about gradle supported java projects read [Gradle Build Init plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_init_plugin.html) documentation.

This command create a `gradle.build` file with the content of -

```gradle
/*
 * This build file was generated by the Gradle 'init' task.
 *
 * This generated file contains a sample Java project to get you started.
 * For more details take a look at the Java Quickstart chapter in the Gradle
 * user guide available at https://docs.gradle.org/4.2.1/userguide/tutorial_java_projects.html
 */

// Apply the java plugin to add support for Java
apply plugin: 'java'

// Apply the application plugin to add support for building an application
apply plugin: 'application'

// In this section you declare where to find the dependencies of your project
repositories {
    // Use jcenter for resolving your dependencies.
    // You can declare any Maven/Ivy/file repository here.
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    // This dependency is found on compile classpath of this component and consumers.
    compile 'com.google.guava:guava:22.0'

    // Use JUnit test framework
    testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
}

// Define the main class for the application
mainClassName = 'App'
```

To check all tasks of the project run -

```bash
gradle task --all
```

Now if you run

```bash
gradle build
```

then the `distribution`(**executable**) file will be found in  `buld>distributions` folder. It create `tar` and `zip` archive. You can extract and use any of those type of archieve.
