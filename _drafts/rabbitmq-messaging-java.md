In this blog post I am going to discuss about how to send message between two java spring boot application using RabbitMQ message broker. 

## Create initial spring boot applicaiton(two)
from  spring boot initializer website with amqp (rabbitmq) dependency

## Write message publisher

**Please note:** exhange that work as direct and fanout exchange depending on bindings
{: .notice--danger}

## Write message receiver
